                    Charles Aznavour (/ˌæznəˈvʊər/ AZ-nə-VOOR, French: [ʃaʁl 
                    aznavuʁ]; born Shahnour Vaghinag Aznavourian, Armenian: 
                    Շահնուր Վաղինակ Ազնավուրյան, Shahnur Vaghinak Aznavuryan; 
                    22 May 1924 – 1 October 2018) was a French-Armenian singer, 
                    ricist, actor and diplomat. Aznavour was known for his distinctive 
                    tenor voice: clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with gravelly 
                    and profound low notes. In a career as a composer, singer and songwriter,
                    spanning over 70 years, he recorded more than 1,200 songs interpreted in 9 
                    languages. Moreover, he wrote or co-wrote more than 1,000 songs for himself and others.
                    One of France's most popular and enduring singers, Aznavour sold between 180 
                    and 200 million records during his lifetime, making him one of 
                    the best-selling music artists of all time. He was dubbed France's Frank Sinatra,
                    while music critic Stephen Holden described Aznavour as a "French pop 
                    deity". He was also arguably the most famous Armenian of his time. 
                    In 1998, Aznavour was named Entertainer of the Century by CNN and users of 
                    Time Online from around the globe. He was recognized as the century's
                    outstanding performer, with nearly 18% of the total vote, edging out Elvis 
                    Presley and Bob Dylan. Jean Cocteau once said: "Before Aznavour despair was 
                    unpopular". Aznavour sang for presidents, popes and royalty, as well as 
                    at humanitarian events. In response to the 1988 Armenian earthquake, he founded 
                    the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time 
                    friend impresario Levon Sayan. In 2008, he was granted Armenian citizenship,
                    and was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland the following year, 
                    as well as Armenia's permanent delegate to the United Nations at Geneva.
                    He started his last world tour in 2014. On 24 August 2017, Aznavour was awarded
                    he 2,618th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later that year, he and his 
                    sister were awarded the Raoul Wallenberg Award for sheltering Jews during 
                    World War II. His last concert took place in the NHK Hall in Osaka on 19 
                    September 2018. He died on 1 October 2018, aged 94.

                <h2>
                    Career
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aznavour was already familiar with performing on stage by the time he began 
                    his career as a musician. At the age of nine, he had roles in a play called 
                    Un Petit Diable à Paris and a film entitled La Guerre des Gosses.
                    Aznavour then turned to professional dancing and performed in several 
                    nightclubs. In 1944, he and actor Pierre Roche began a partnership and in 
                    collaborative efforts performed in numerous nightclubs. It was through this 
                    partnership that Aznavour began to write songs and sing. The partnership's 
                    first successes were in Canada in 1948-1950. Meanwhile, Aznavour wrote his 
                    first song entitled J'ai Bu in 1950. Aznavour in 1963 During the early stages 
                    of his career, Aznavour opened for Edith Piaf at the Moulin Rouge. Piaf then 
                    advised him to pursue a career in singing. Piaf helped Aznavour develop 
                    a distinctive voice that stimulated the best of his abilities.Sometimes described 
                    as "France's Frank Sinatra",Aznavour sang frequently about love. He wrote or 
                    co-wrote musicals, more than one thousand songs, and recorded ninety-one studio 
                    albums. Aznavour's voice was shaded towards the tenor range, but possessed the 
                    low range and coloration more typical of a baritone, contributing to his unique 
                    sound. Aznavour spoke and sang in many languages (French, English, Italian, Spanish, 
                    German, Russian, Armenian, Neapolitan and Kabyle), which helped him perform at Carnegie 
                    Hall, in the US, and other major venues around the world. He also recorded at least one 
                    song from the 18th-century Armenian poet Sayat-Nova, and a popular song, Im Yare in Armenian. 
                    "Que C'est Triste Venise", sung in French, Italian ("Com'è Triste Venezia"), Spanish ("Venecia Sin Ti"), 
                    English ("How Sad Venice Can Be") and German ("Venedig in Grau"), was very successful the mid 1960s.
                    1972 saw the release of his 23rd studio album, "Idiote je t'aime...", which contained among others, 
                    two of his classics - Les plaisirs démodés (Old-Fashioned Pleasures) et Comme ils disent (As They Say), 
                    the latter dealing with homosexuality, which at the time, was revolutionary.In 1974, Aznavour became 
                    a major success in the United Kingdom when his song "She" was number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for 
                    four weeks during a fourteen-week run. His other well-known song in the UK was the 1973 "The Old 
                    Fashioned Way", which was on UK charts for 15 weeks. Artists who have recorded his songs and collaborated 
                    with Aznavour include Édith Piaf, Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra (Aznavour was one of the 
                    are European singers invited to duet with him), Andrea Bocelli, Bing Crosby, Ray 
                    Charles, Bob Dylan (he named Aznavour among the greatest live performers he had 
                    ever seen), Dusty Springfield, Liza Minnelli, Mia Martini, Elton John, Dalida, 
                    Serge Gainsbourg, Josh Groban, Petula Clark, Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, José 
                    Carreras, Laura Pausini, Roy Clark, Nana Mouskouri and Julio Iglesias. Fellow 
                    French pop singer Mireille Mathieu sang and recorded with Aznavour on numerous 
                    occasions. The English singer Marc Almond was noted by Aznavour as his favourite 
                    nterpreter of his songs, having covered Aznavour's "What makes a man a man" in the 
                    90s. Almond citing Aznavour as a major influence on his style and work. In 1974, 
                    Jack Jones recorded an entire album of Aznavour compositions entitled Write Me A 
                    Love Song, Charlie, re-released on CD in 2006. Two years later, in 1976, Dutch singer 
                    iesbeth List released her album Charles Aznavour Presents Liesbeth List, which featured
                    Aznavour's compositions with English lyrics. Aznavour and Italian tenor Luciano 
                    Pavarotti sang Gounod's aria "Ave Maria" together. He performed with Russian cellist 
                    and friend Mstislav Rostropovich to inaugurate the French presidency of the European 
                    Union in 1995. Elvis Costello recorded "She" for the film Notting Hill. One of 
                    Aznavour's greatest friends and collaborators from the music industry was Spanish 
                    operatic tenor Plácido Domingo, who often performs his hits, most notably a solo 
                    studio recording of "Les bâteaux sont partis" in 1985 and duet versions of the song 
                    in French and Spanish in 2008, as well as multiple live renditions of Aznavour's 
                    "Ave Maria". In 1994, Aznavour performed with Domingo again and Norwegian soprano 
                    Sissel Kyrkjebø at Domingo's third annual Christmas in Vienna concert. The three 
                    singers performed a variety of carols, medleys and duets, and the concert was 
                    televised throughout the world, as well as released on a CD internationally.<br />
                    t the start of autumn 2006, Aznavour initiated his farewell tour, performing in the 
                    US and Canada, and earning very positive reviews. Aznavour started 2007 with concerts
                     all over Japan and Asia. The second half of 2007 saw Aznavour return to Paris for over 
                     20 shows at the Palais des Congrès in Paris, followed by more touring in Belgium, the 
                     Netherlands, and the rest of France. Aznavour had repeatedly stated that this farewell 
                     tour, health permitting, would likely last beyond 2010; after that, however, Charle
                     Aznavour continued performing worldwide throughout the year. At 84, 60 years on stage 
                    ade him "a little hard of hearing".[43] In his final years he would still sing in multiple 
                    languages and without persistent use of teleprompters, but typically he would stick to just 
                    two or three (French and English being the primary two, with Spanish or Italian being the third) 
                    during most concerts.[44] On 30 September 2006, Aznavour performed a major concert in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, to start off the cultural season "Arménie mon amie". Then Armenian president Robert Kocharyan and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac, at the time on an official visit to Armenia, were in front-row attendance.
                    Aznavour at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival In 2006, Aznavour recorded his album Colore 
                    ma vie in Cuba, with Chucho Valdés.A regular guest vocalist on Star Academy, Aznavour 
                    sang alongside contestant Cyril Cinélu that same year.[47] In 2007, he sang part of 
                    "Une vie d'amour" in Russian during a Moscow concert. Later, in July 2007, Aznavour 
                    was invited to perform at the Vieilles Charrues Festival.Forever Cool (2007), an album 
                    from Capitol/EMI, features Aznavour singing a new duet of "Everybody Loves Somebody 
                    Sometime" with the voice of Dean Martin.Aznavour finished a tour of Portugal in February 
                    2008. Throughout the spring of 2008, Aznavour toured South America, holding a multitude
                     of concerts in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay.

                <h2>Armenian activism</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the 1988 Armenian earthquake, Aznavour helped the country through 
                    his charity, Aznavour for Armenia. Together with his brother in-law and 
                    co-author Georges Garvarentz he wrote the song "Pour toi Arménie", which 
                    was performed by a group of famous French artists and topped the charts 
                    for eighteen weeks. There is a square named after him in central Yerevan 
                    on Abovian Street, and a statue erected in Gyumri, which saw the most 
                    lives lost in the earthquake. In 1995 Aznavour was appointed an Ambassador 
                    and Permanent Delegate of Armenia to UNESCO. Aznavour was a member of the 
                    Armenia Fund International Board of Trustees. The organization has rendered 
                    more than $150 million in humanitarian aid and infrastructure development
                     assistance to Armenia since 1992. He was appointed as "Officier" (Officer) 
                     of the Légion d'honneur in 1997.In 2002, Aznavour appeared in director 
                     Atom Egoyan's acclaimed film Ararat, about the genocide of Armenians 
                    in the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century.<br/>
                    In 2004, Aznavour received the title of National Hero of Armenia, 
                    Armenia's highest award. On 26 December 2008, President of Armenia 
                    Serzh Sargsyan signed a presidential decree for granting citizenship 
                    of Armenia to Aznavour whom he called a "prominent singer and public 
                    figure" and "a hero of the Armenian people".<br />
                    In 2011, the Charles Aznavour Museum opened in Yerevan.<br />
                    In April 2016, Aznavour visited Armenia to participate in the Aurora 
                    Prize Award ceremony. On 24 April, along with Serzh Sargsyan, the 
                    Catholicos of All Armenians, Garegin II and actor George Clooney, he 
                    laid flowers at the Armenian Genocide Memorial.<br />
                    In October 2016 Aznavour joined other prominent Armenians on calling 
                    the government of Armenia to adopt "new development strategies based 
                    on inclusiveness and collective action" and to create "an opportunity 
                    for the Armenian world to pivot toward a future of prosperity, to 
                    transform the post-Soviet Armenian Republic into a vibrant, modern, 
                    secure, peaceful and progressive homeland for a global nation." <br />
                    Along with holding the mostly ceremonial title of French 
                    ambassador-at-large to Armenia, Aznavour agreed to hold the position 
                    of Ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland on 12 February 2009:<br /> <br />
                    First I hesitated, as it is not an easy task. Then I thought that what 
                    is important for Armenia is important for us. I have accepted the proposal with 
                    love, happiness and feeling of deep dignity. <br />
                    He wrote a song about the Armenian Genocide, entitled "Ils sont tombés" 
                    (known in English as "They fell").

                <h2>Political involvement</h2>
                <p>
                    Aznavour was increasingly involved in French, Armenian and 
                    international politics as his career progressed. During the 2002 
                    French presidential elections, when far-right nationalist Jean-Marie
                     Le Pen of the National Front made it into the runoff election, facing 
                     cumbent Jacques Chirac, Aznavour signed the "Vive la France" petition, 
                     and called on all French to "sing the Marseillaise" in protest. Chirac, 
                     a personal friend of Aznavour's, ended up winning in a landslide, 
                     carrying over 82% of the vote. <br />
                     He frequently campaigned for international copyright law reform. 
                     In November 2005 he met with then President of the European 
                     Commission José Manuel Barroso[82] on the issue of the review 
                     of term of protection for performers and producers in the EU, 
                     advocating an extension of the EU's term of protection from the 
                     current 50 years to the United States' law allowing 95 years, saying 
                     "[o]n term of protection, artists and record companies are of the 
                     same mind. Extension of term of protection would be good for European 
                     lture, positive for the European economy and would put an end the 
                     current discrimination with the U.S." He also notably butted heads 
                     with French politician Christine Boutin over her defense of a "global 
                     license" flat-fee authorization for sharing of copyrighted files over 
                     the internet, claiming that the license would eliminate creativity. 
                     In May 2009, the French Senate approved one of the strictest internet 
                     anti-piracy bills ever with a landslide 189–14 vote. Aznavour was a 
                     vocal proponent of the measure and considered it a rousing victory:

            <div>
                <h2>Personal life</h2>
                <p>
                    Aznavour was married three times: to Micheline Rugel (in 1946),Evelyn 
                    Plessis (in 1956) and his widow, Ulla Thorsell (in 1967). Five children 
                    were produced by these marriages: Seda, Patrick, Katia, Mischa, and 
                    Nicolas.A sixth child, Charles Jr., supposedly born in 1952, was invented 
                    by Yves Salgues, who was Aznavour's first official biographer, but also a 
                    heroin addict.[citation needed] <br />
                    Aznavour often joked about his physique, the most talked-about aspect of 
                    which was his height; he stood 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall. He made this a 
                    source of self-deprecating humour over the years.<br />
                    In April 2018, shortly before his 94th birthday, Aznavour was taken to 
                    hospital in Saint Petersburg after straining his back during a rehearsal 
                    prior to a concert in the city. The concert was postponed until the 
                    following season, but eventually cancelled since he died six months later.
                    On 5 May 2018, he was a guest on BBC Radio 2's Graham Norton.
                    A week later, on 12 May, he broke his arm in two places in a fall at 
                    his home in the village of Mouriès, resulting in the cancellation of 
                    all shows until the end of June. This was eventually extended to

                <p>
                    On 1 October 2018, Aznavour was found dead in a bathtub at his home at 
                    Mouriès at the age of 94.At the time of his death his tax residence was 
                    in Saint-Sulpice, Vaud, Switzerland.The autopsy report concluded that 
                    Aznavour died of cardiorespiratory arrest complicated by an acute 
                    pulmonary edema.A requiem mass for him was held on October 6 by 
                    Catholicos Karekin II at the Armenian Cathedral of St. John the Baptist 
                    in Paris. <br />
                    On 5 October, Aznavour was honoured with a state funeral at Les 
                    Invalides military complex in Paris, with president Emmanuel Macron 
                    lauding him as one of the most important “faces of France”. He praised 
                    znavour's lyrics, which he said appealed to "our secret fragility" and 
                    said the singer's words were "for millions of people a balm, a remedy, 
                    a comfort ... For so many decades, he has made our life sweeter, our 
                    tears less bitter." His coffin was lifted away at the end to the sound 
                    of his hit song "Emmenez-Moi" (Take Me Along).Dignitaries attending the 
                    funeral also included French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, former 
                    presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, as well as Armenian
